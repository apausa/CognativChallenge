# Callenge Cognativ

React Native challenge for Cognativ

## Run the app. 

* cd ios 
* pod install
* npx react-native start
* npx react-native run-ios

## About

This project is used to evaluate your approach on re-order y refactor of javascript code and your basic knowledge in React Native, take it easy.

### Required tasks

* Run the app correctly on both iOS & Android environment
* Install react-navigation
* Configure the navigation to support List of recipes (Home) -> Recipe details (Details), navigating one to the other
* Re-write the 2 class component (Home & Details) as functional components and move the lifecycle logic to appropriates hooks (if needed)
* Re-organize the code of the 2 screens in a more appropriate and readable way, following YOUR OWN criteria.
* Connect to the api: https://virated-api.herokuapp.com/recipes for recipes and https://virated-api.herokuapp.com/recipes?recommended=1 for recommended dishes instead of the fake data (for example using axios)

### Nice to have

* Convert the JS files to TypeScript and create the correct interfaces
* Write down some unit tests to achieve coding coverage > 70%
* Reorganize your code to use a state manager (MobX & Recoil will be preferred but Redux or other alternatives will be considered valid, but please Keep It Stupid Simple)
